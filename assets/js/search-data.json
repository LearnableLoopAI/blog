            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

            "title": "Resampling Methods",
            "content": "Parametric procedures compare observed statistics to sampling distributions based on solid theoretical principles. However, there are always conditions on the data before these procedures can be applied. Resampling is a revolutionary procedure for it departs from strict theoretical principles and simply base its inferences on statistics obtained from repeated resampling of the same sample. In other words, there is no need to satisfy parametric conditions on the data. Even so, resampling is not the only technique that allows a researcher this relaxation of conditions. There is a wide variety of so-called non-parametric methods. When parametric conditions are not satisfied, a valid question then becomes, should one first attempt to use resampling techniques, or is it better to first go with the other non-parametric methods. . As mentioned, there is a large group of other non-parametric methods with a great diversity of approaches. It pays to be familiar with at least a rudimentary knowledge of the theory of an approach before it is applied to a problem. In contrast to this situation, one may simply use a resampling method. The basic principles of resampling are not hard to grasp and there is hardly a diversity of theory among its variants. . As pointed out by Chuong Ho Yu in his 2002 article, called Resampling methods: Concepts, Applications, and Justification (see https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1128&amp;context=pare), there are four main types of resampling methods: Permutation test, Cross-validation, Jackknife, and Bootstrap. Even so, the underpinnings of the methods are not far apart. Ho makes a point of this too: “The principles of cross-validation, Jackknife, and bootstrap are very similar, but bootstrap overshadows the others for it is a more thorough procedure in the sense that it draws many more sub-samples than the others.” In other words, three of the four main classes are very similar, and the class that deviates mainly does so because it draws more resamples than the other three. . In a sense, the resampling methods represent a “generic” approach for a sub-group of non-parametric methods that represents a valuable economy of expression that is always welcome in a complicated discipline such as statistics. This in itself, to me, is a good reason to use resampling as a first resort, rather than other non-parametric methods. . Resampling techniques have some definite advantages. Often there is not a clear-cut decision on whether parametric conditions hold or the extent to which they hold. The researcher’s mind may be eased by simply using a resampling method. Furthermore, the concepts behind resampling is clean and simple. There is no need to have a mathematical background or other special smarts. As a matter of fact, some studies have shown that students new to statistics fared better when taught using resampling techniques than students that came through traditional statistics schooling (cited in Rudner &amp; Shafer, 1992). . The most fundamental requirement for parametric or other procedures is that the sample be representative or random. It seems that even this condition might be circumvented when using a resampling method (Edgington 1995). Not all researchers agree on this point though. Another advantage is in the case of studies with a small sample size. Even if parametric conditions are satisfied the test may suffer from a low level of power. In this case the bootstrap method could be applied to treat the small sample as a virtual population and just generate a sufficient number of observations. Similarly, a resampling technique may come to the rescue when the sample size is too “large” in a situation of overpowering. . As always, there is the other side of the coin. One criticism of resampling was voiced by S. E. Fienberg when he said: “You’re trying to get something for nothing. You use the same numbers over and over again until you get an answer that you can’t get any other way. In order to do that, you have to assume something, and you may live to regret that hidden assumption later on” (cited in Peterson, 1991, p. 57). Another criticism finds fault with the idea that the whole technique of resampling is based on a single sample (no surprise here). The point is that the generalization cannot go beyond that specific sample. Other critics have a problem with bias in the data that was collected. Their point is that resampling would simply repeat and magnify the bias. One more criticism is that resampling may be less accurate than traditional parametric methods unless sufficient experimental trials are performed – not a very convincing argument given today’s prominent landscape of low-cost computing. . To summarize, the mentioned advantages should be convincing as to the virtues of resampling methods in general. More specifically, the idea of having a “generic” approach when a non-parametric method is called for, rather than a wide variety of non-parametric approaches sounds appealing. This allows for a valuable economy of expression in the non-parametric area. Finally, the attractive landscape of extremely affordable computing resources leaves no excuse (in my mind) for not reaching first for a resampling method, when a non-parametric method is called for. .
